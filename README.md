# 42 Net_Practice

Welcome to the 42 Net_Practice project repository! This repository contains a collection of exercises and resources designed to help you practice subnetting concepts in the context of the 42 school curriculum. Subnetting is an essential skill for network administrators and engineers, and these exercises will help you master the techniques involved.

## Introduction

The 42 Net_Practice project is designed to provide hands-on practice with subnetting concepts such as IP addressing, subnet masks, CIDR notation, and subnetting calculations. Each exercise focuses on a specific subnetting topic and includes detailed instructions, practice problems, and solutions to reinforce your understanding.

## Exercises

1. **Level 1 to Level 3: Introduction to IP Addressing**
   - Topics covered: IPv4 addressing, binary representation of IP addresses, classes of IP addresses.
   - Exercises: Converting IP addresses between decimal and binary notation, identifying the class of an IP address.

2. **Level 4 to Level 6: Subnet Masks and CIDR Notation**
   - Topics covered: Subnet masks, CIDR notation, subnetting basics.
   - Exercises: Calculating subnet masks, determining the subnet range of IP addresses in CIDR notation.

3. **Level 7 to Level 10: Subnetting Practice**
   - Topics covered: Subnetting techniques, subnetting scenarios, subnet design.
   - Exercises: Subnetting practice problems involving various subnetting scenarios, including VLSM.
